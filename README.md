# fasterCV
Ensemble of data preprocessing, training tricks, logging, model testing, and model deployment as well as the directory structure to simple the  development of deep leaning with pytorch

# Data preprocessing
lib/processing_utils.py:
face detection,
landmarks detectionï¼Œ
video to frame and frame to face, and so on.

# Training tricks
lib/model_utils.py

mixup, warmup,cosine learning rate decay, logging, train, test and deploy model.
Model visualization with t-sen.
